/**
 * A Munsell Lab color system with a uniform perceptual distribution of the
 * colors.
 * <p>
 * The three coordinates of CIELAB represent the lightness of the color
 * (L* = 0 yields black and L* = 100 indicates diffuse white; specular white
 * may be higher),
 * its position between red/magenta and green (a*, negative values indicate
 * green while positive values indicate magenta) and its position between
 * yellow and blue (b*, negative values indicate blue and positive values
 * indicate yellow).
 * <p>
 * In this color model all LAB values are normalized to lie between 0 and 1.
 * <p>
 * The ICC profile used by this color system has been taken from
 * <a href="http://www.brucelindbloom.com/index.html?MunsellCalcHelp.html">
