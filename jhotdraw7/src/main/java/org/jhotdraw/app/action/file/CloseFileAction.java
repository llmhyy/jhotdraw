/**
 * Closes the active view after letting the user save unsaved changes.
 * {@code DefaultSDIApplication} automatically exits when the user
 * closes the last view.
 * <p>
 * This action is called when the user selects the Close item in the File
 * menu. The menu item is automatically created by the application.
 * <p>
 * If you want this behavior in your application, you have to create it
 * and put it in your {@code ApplicationModel) in method
 * {@link ApplicationModel#initApplication}.
 * <p>
 * You should include this action in applications which use at least
 * one of the following actions, so that the user can close views that he/she
 * created: {@code FileNewAction}, {@code FileNewWindowAction},
 * {@code FileOpenAction}, {@code FileOpenDirectoryAction}.
